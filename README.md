# Flutter Counter App

This repository features a basic Flutter application that demonstrates the use of a StatefulWidget to manage dynamic state in a mobile app. The app includes a FloatingActionButton that increments a counter each time it is pressed, with the updated count displayed on the screen. This is the default Flutter starter template and serves as a great starting point for those new to Flutter development. It showcases concepts like widget trees, state management with setState(), and UI building using MaterialApp, Scaffold, and other Flutter widgets.
